#+TITLE: HttpServer (tested against cob_spec)

[[https://travis-ci.org/mathpunk/HttpServer.svg?branch=master]]

** Prerequisites
   - Java 8
   - gradle
   
** Testing
   
*** Running tests manually
    
    Unit tests may be run using `gradle test`. They are also automatically run as part of `gradle build`. To run the current passing cob_spec tests, build the project, then:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd cob_spec
   ./suite
   #+END_SRC 

  
*** Automated testing
    
    Travis runs the passing tests in `cob_spec/suite`. The `.travis.yml` file is periodically updated to include newly passing tests.
    

** Usage
   
   These commands will build the project and start the server running on port 5000 and serving resources from the `resources` path.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   gradle build
   java -jar build/libs/HttpServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -p 5000 -d resources
   #+END_SRC
