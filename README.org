#+TITLE: HttpServer (tested against cob_spec)

[[https://travis-ci.org/mathpunk/HttpServer.svg?branch=master]]

** Prerequisites
   - Java 8
   - gradle
   - ruby 
   - rake (`gem install rake`)
   
** Testing
   
*** Running tests manually
    
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   rake run_passing
   #+END_SRC 
   
   This task is updated as more acceptance tests pass.
  
*** Automated testing
    
    Travis uses the Rakefile to run the passing cob_spec tests. 
    

** Usage
   
   To start the server on port 5000 and serving the resources in `cob_spec/public`:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   rake serve
   #+END_SRC
   
   Using a different port and resource directory is not currently implemented.
